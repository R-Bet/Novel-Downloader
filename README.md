This application is built to download chapters of web novels off websites and save them as TXTs.

Field explanations:

"URL" has to be some URL with a number in it that signifies the chapter number, for example https://novel.com/novelname/chapter-[i]/.

[i] signifies the chapter number, which loops through fields "Min number" and "Max number".

"Content ID" signifies the div that contains the chapter content itself, which is usually consistent throughout any website.

"Download folder" is where to create the TXT files at. You can paste in or click "Pick folder" button to find the folder.

"Chapter name" is the pattern for the TXT names. For example, chapter name set as "Chapter [i]" would name chapter number 3 "Chapter 3".

Setup included in "Setup" folder.

I do not condone pirating, and this application is made as proof of concept.
